Portfolio choice problems have had a profound influence on the finance industry. Modern portfolio theory and analysis build upon the seminal work of Markowitz. However, it has been proved to be highly sensitive to the expected rate of return and the covariance matrix which are hard to estimate, leading to an incomprehensible result in investment practices.
